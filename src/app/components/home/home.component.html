    This is small programming assignment for showing my capabilities in order to become a SAIL research lab member. In this Project I have shown last 25 articles from CNN. Also, the project means to show the latest twits from Donald J. Trump. As a cool feature you can find articles about anything on CNN by just searching it. This feature is working the same for twitter.
